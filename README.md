# DigiQuests
A quest log flask app to manage your to do list in a fun way with an auto-check system able to examine automatically if a quest is complete or not. It was built upon the skyrim theme and was inspired by the app **Quest Log** published by **PZED** that can be found on play store [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.app.stodo)


## What has been done 
The app allows for now for a single user to add and edit quests to the quest log. This is the V0 and more work will be done shortly.

## install
```console
git clone https://github.com/TuburboMajus/DigiQuests
cd DigiQuests
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python install/install.py # Enter your mysql database credentials
python run.py
```

## What's to be done

- Users management
- Sharing quests with other users and rights management
- Create auto-trackers to observe tasks & quests completion
- Enable users to sync quests with other calendars (google calendar, ...)
- Mobile app (for this one I'm waiting a bit If by any chance **PZED** will find this git and contact me to see if we can join efforts to build upon his app as I didn't succeed in finding his contact.)
